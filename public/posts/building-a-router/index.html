It was a locked-down, underwhelming piece of junk. My first real router, though, was a legend: the Linksys WRT54G, recommended by PC Magazine. My family used that thing for nearly a decade. It was rock solid.\nFunny how companies forget what made them great. The WRT54G was ahead of its time. Years later, after college, my roommate and I pulled one out of the trash and resurrected it. We modded it with OpenWRT, and it ran for another three years until 2017‚Äîwhen it could no longer keep up. Its single-core processor simply couldn‚Äôt handle modern bandwidth demands, let alone the explosion of smart devices and IoT.\nLinksys discontinuation of this line is akin to Ford abandoning the Taurus‚Ä¶only bringing it back later.\nWhen Promise Meets Disappointment Next came the TP-Link Archer C7/C8/C9 era. At launch, these were strong contenders‚Äîespecially at their price point. They regularly outperformed routers from Netgear, D-Link, and even Linksys. ASUS came close, but TP-Link had the edge in price-to-performance.\nUnfortunately, that promise faded fast. Within five years, they were showing their age. Worse, TP-Link‚Äôs decision to lock down the firmware made open-source support a nightmare. No OpenWRT, no Tomato‚Äîjust headaches. (Eventually, DD-WRT became available, but it felt like an afterthought.)\nIronically, TP-Link is a Chinese company‚Äîand yet, their product went against any spirit of collectivism or community. No sharing, no support, and minimal configurability. You‚Äôd expect a little more openness, but I guess it‚Äôs only communal when it‚Äôs convenient. That once-promising router now sits in storage‚Äîexiled like a fallen comrade.\nThe Return of a Classic In the mid-2010s, Linksys tried to recapture the magic with the WRT3200ACM‚Äîa spiritual successor to the WRT54G. I picked one up during the pandemic, and for a while, it felt like the legend was back. And to be fair, it held its own for years.\nBut five years later, it‚Äôs starting to show its limits again‚Äîoccasional issues with the 5GHz band, for example. Still, not bad for a router approaching its ten-year mark. Alas, there is no real sucesssor to the WRT3200ACM offered by Linkssys that I am aware of.\nAgain, Linksys discontinuation of this line is akin to Ford abandoning the Taurus‚Ä¶for the 2nd time (they really did this)!\nüì° Router Spec Breakdown üîπ Linksys WRT54G The early-2000s classic that set the standard\nSpec Details Release Year ~2002 Wi-Fi Standard 802.11b/g (2.4GHz only) Wi-Fi Speed Up to 54 Mbps CPU Broadcom BCM5352 @ 200 MHz RAM 16 MB (early), 8 MB (later) Flash Storage 4 MB (or 2 MB on cost-reduced versions) Ethernet Ports 1 WAN + 4 LAN (10/100 Mbps) Antenna 2x external 2 dBi Open-Source Support Excellent (OpenWRT, DD-WRT, Tomato) Notes Revered for hackability, especially versions 1‚Äì4 Cost $180 üîπ TP-Link Archer C8 A solid mid-2010s performer that aged poorly\nSpec Details Release Year ~2014 Wi-Fi Standard 802.11ac (dual-band: 2.4GHz + 5GHz) Wi-Fi Speed AC1750 (450 Mbps + 1300 Mbps) CPU Broadcom BCM4708A0 @ 800 MHz (dual-core) RAM 128 MB Flash Storage 16 MB Ethernet Ports 1 WAN + 4 LAN (Gigabit) USB Ports 1x USB 3.0, 1x USB 2.0 Antenna 3x external Open-Source Support Poor (locked bootloader on most models) Notes Strong start, but firmware lock-in killed its longevity Cost $100 üîπ Linksys WRT3200ACM The spiritual successor, with caveats\nSpec Details Release Year 2016 Wi-Fi Standard 802.11ac (dual-band, MU-MIMO support) Wi-Fi Speed AC3200 (600 Mbps + 2600 Mbps theoretical) CPU Marvell Armada 88F6820 @ 1.8 GHz (dual-core) RAM 512 MB DDR3 Flash Storage 256 MB NAND Ethernet Ports 1 WAN + 4 LAN (Gigabit) USB Ports 1x USB 3.0, 1x combo eSATA/USB 2.0 Antenna 4x external high-performance Open-Source Support Very good (OpenWRT supported, but finicky) Notes Marketed to enthusiasts, but plagued by Marvell Wi-Fi driver issues (which affected feasability of opensource firmwares like openwrt and ddwrt Cost $250 üîπ ASUS RT‚ÄëAX5400 A modern dual-band Wi-Fi 6 router with solid internals\nSpec Details Release Year 2023 Wi-Fi Standard Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax), dual-band Max Speed AX5400 (574 Mbps + 4804 Mbps) CPU Triple-core @ 1.5 GHz RAM 512 MB Flash 256 MB Ethernet 1√ó 2.5 GbE WAN + 4√ó 1 GbE LAN USB Ports 1x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Firmware AsusWRT (AiProtection, AiMesh support) Notes Great performance for the price, but firmware remains closed-source Cost $120 What I Really Want in a Router Here‚Äôs what I actually care about in a modern router:\n‚úÖ Dual 2.5GbE ports (not one token 2.5GbE + 4x 1GbE gimmick) ‚úÖ Quad-core CPU @ 2.0 GHz or better ‚úÖ At least 1 GB of RAM ‚úÖ Open-source firmware support ‚úÖ The ability to export and import configurations and mappings These aren‚Äôt outlandish demands‚Äîthey‚Äôre just basic features for power users. But almost no consumer router on the market delivers this combination out of the box consistently other than NetGate and maybe Ubiquiti though both are considered prosumer if not enterprise and thus quite pricy some even costing as much as $600 or $900.\nüîç The State of Consumer Routers in 2025 Let‚Äôs take a snapshot of what‚Äôs available right now:\nüîπ Asus RT‚ÄëBE58U Spec Details Release Year 2024 Wi‚ÄëFi Standard Wi‚ÄëFi‚ÄØ7 (802.11be), dual-band Max Speed ~3.6‚ÄØGbps (688 + 2882‚ÄØMbps) CPU Quad‚Äëcore @ 2.0‚ÄØGHz RAM 1‚ÄØGB Flash 256‚ÄØMB üîπ Netgear Nighthawk RS300 Spec Details Release Year 2025 Wi‚ÄëFi Standard Wi‚ÄëFi‚ÄØ7, tri-band (2.4/5/6‚ÄØGHz) Max Speed ~9.3‚ÄØGbps CPU Quad‚Äëcore @ 2.0‚ÄØGHz RAM 2‚ÄØGB Flash 512‚ÄØMB NAND üîπ Netgear Nighthawk Pro Gaming XR1000 Spec Details Release Year 2021 Wi‚ÄëFi Standard Wi‚ÄëFi‚ÄØ6 (AX5400), dual-band Max Speed ~5.4‚ÄØGbps (600 + 4800‚ÄØMbps) CPU Triple‚Äëcore @ 1.5‚ÄØGHz RAM / Flash Not specified officially üîπ TP-Link BE3600 (Archer BE3600) Spec Details Release Year 2024 Wi‚ÄëFi Standard Wi‚ÄëFi‚ÄØ7, dual-band Max Speed ~3.6‚ÄØGbps CPU Quad‚Äëcore @ ~2.0‚ÄØGHz RAM 2‚ÄØGB DDR4 Flash 256‚ÄØMB üîπ TP-Link Archer AX55 Spec Details Release Year 2022 Wi‚ÄëFi Standard Wi‚ÄëFi‚ÄØ6 (AX3000), dual-band Max Speed ~2.976‚ÄØGbps CPU Dual‚Äëcore @ 1.0‚ÄØGHz (Qualcomm IPQ0518) RAM 512‚ÄØMB Flash 128‚ÄØMB üîπ Asus RT‚ÄëBE96U Spec Details Release Year 2024 Wi‚ÄëFi Standard Wi‚ÄëFi‚ÄØ7 (tri-band: 2.4 / 5 / 6‚ÄØGHz) Max Speed ~18.7‚ÄØGbps CPU Quad‚Äëcore @ 2.6‚ÄØGHz RAM 2‚ÄØGB DDR4 Flash 256‚ÄØMB üß© Market Summary Entry-level (\u003c $100)\nStill mostly plastic boxes with questionable firmware support, aging chipsets, and no forward-thinking features.\nMid-tier ($100‚Äì$300)\nMore capable hardware, but UI/UX remains clunky. Still no standard config backup/export tools (like what if I wanted to export configs between makes and models). Monitoring features are weak.\nHigh-end ($300+)\nYou‚Äôre mostly paying for marketing: ‚Äúmesh,‚Äù ‚Äúgaming,‚Äù RGB antennas. Hardware‚Äôs better, but it rarely gives you real control.\nWhat Manufacturers Are Pushing (That I Don‚Äôt Want) Mesh systems: These are often brand-locked and exist to sell you more hardware. It reminds me of early 2000s Wi-Fi gear‚Äîwhere a Linksys adapter worked best with a Linksys router and a NetGear adapter best with a NetGear router. I suspect this is probalby due to differences in firmware and perhaps lack of standards across manufactuers.\nWi-Fi 6E and 7: Honestly? I don‚Äôt even know what version I‚Äôm on. Probably Wi-Fi 5. The naming conventions are confusing, and the benefits aren‚Äôt clear to me. It just comes off as marketing nonsense to me. Something to get me hyped up to buy a new router thinking my old one is obsolete.\nTri-band \u0026 ‚Äúgaming‚Äù routers: Just marketing bloat, in most cases. Unless you‚Äôre in a multi-floor household with dozens of high-throughput devices, the extra bands do very little. And the extra antennas look sily. I‚Äôd rather have more RAM and CPU. Or atleast a router that looks ornamental like a Excalibur (Sword In The Stone), Taj Mahal, Stone Henge. I‚Äôd even take an Eiffel Tower looking router if its all about big pointy antennas.\nIndeed, I found the following:\nIn the early 2000s, Wi-Fi gear from the same brand often worked better together because:\nStandards were immature ‚Äì many devices used draft or inconsistent versions of 802.11b/g. Vendors added proprietary features (like Linksys ‚ÄúSpeedBooster‚Äù) that only worked with matching hardware. Firmware and driver quality varied, leading to bugs and compatibility issues. Security protocols like WPA weren‚Äôt consistently supported across brands. As a result, pairing a Linksys adapter with a Linksys router often gave more stable and faster connections than mixing brands. This issue largely faded by the 2010s as Wi-Fi standards matured and interoperability improved.\nWhy manufactuers insist on pushing mesh products in closed ecosystems? Short term profits. You buy their mesh router, you end up buying their mesh nodes. No mix and matching manufactuers makes and models with one another. Closed ecosystem ‚Äì\u003e more profits.\nWhy manufactuers market Wifi 6 and Wifi 7 instead of giving us more RAM? We‚Äôd probably upgrade less often otherwise. Create scarcity when ample supply (of RAM) exists. Theres no arugment against power draw here ‚Äì its nelgible. no argument against cost either ‚Äì RAM gets significantly cheaper every year.\nWhy manufacturers insist on designing gaming routers to resemble alien warships is beyond me. It feels like a form of aesthetic gatekeeping‚Äîsignaling that unless your gear looks aggressive and overdesigned, you‚Äôre not a ‚Äúreal‚Äù gamer or as I would say enthusisast.\nModern consumer routers often feel like they‚Äôre designed for obsolescence from the moment of inception‚Äîoverhyped with flashy aesthetics, underpowered internals, and a locked-down firmware that resists improvement or longevity.\nReal enthusiasts are ahead of the curve, they‚Äôre early adopters, and they don‚Äôt like limitations. Honestly, are we getting what we really want? I know I am not.\nIt‚Äôs been nearly 25 years since the WRT54G, and while we‚Äôve gotten faster speeds and flashier packaging, core user freedoms and hardware flexibility have regressed. We head aimlessly towards faster speeds be it wifi 7, 8 or 9 and or 2.5Gbe and 10Gbe ethernet connections while neglicting usability (configs) and adequte system resources.\nDon‚Äôt even get me started on the deceptive hardware revisions. A model may advertise a certain CPU or RAM size, only for newer batches to quietly downgrade those specs‚Äîwithout any clear distinctions other than the SKUs.\nThe Real Problem: Locked-Down UI and Vendor Lock-In My biggest frustration with modern consumer routers isn‚Äôt just the hardware‚Äîit‚Äôs the software.\nMost router interfaces are clunky, shallow, and locked down. Want to back up your config? Good luck. Want to reflash it with OpenWRT? Better hope your model wasn‚Äôt quietly locked with a signed bootloader or worse ‚Äì gets bricked during the process. Want to restore IP/MAC assignments or VLAN mappings after a reset? You‚Äôll probably have to do it all manually unless the manufacturer kindly included some way to import or export configs. Even then, good luck accomplishing this across different manufacturers let alone different models within the same manufacturer. There is absolutely no standardization in the industry.\nMeanwhile, NAS platforms like TrueNAS from iXsystems let you export and restore full system configurations in seconds. That‚Äôs what I expect in 2025. Yet routers like my TP-Link Archer C8 and even my more recent Linksys WRT3200ACM don‚Äôt consistently offer this basic functionality.\nWhy is this so rare?\nEnter Open Source: pfSense The open-source community gets it right. Specifically, pfSense.\nWith pfSense, you get:\n‚úÖ Full configuration export/import ‚úÖ VLANs, traffic shaping, firewall rules‚Äîwithout artificial limits ‚úÖ Logs and monitoring tools that are actually useful ‚úÖ Documentation and community support that doesn‚Äôt leave you guessing Instead of marketing gimmicks and firmware restrictions, pfSense gives you control‚Äîwhich is all I‚Äôve ever really wanted from a router.\nWhat‚Äôs Next for Me So, I‚Äôm building my own router.\nI‚Äôll either:\nRepurpose a community-favorite office PC like the Lenovo ThinkCentre, or Build a small-form-factor ITX box using spare parts. Either way, I‚Äôm done with closed ecosystems that treat configurability like an afterthought.\nWhat I Want In My Router ‚úÖ 2x 2.5GbE ports ‚úÖ Quad-core Intel (7th/8th gen, T-series preferred) ‚úÖ 8 GB DDR4 RAM ‚úÖ pfSense with full config export/import ‚úÖ My existing ASUS RT-AX5400 will serve as a Wi-Fi access point Rather than build everything from scratch (which can easily drive costs over $100), I‚Äôm aiming for a used Lenovo ThinkCentre M920q‚Äîhighly recommended by the pfSense community for its reliability, efficiency, and mod potential.\nüîπ Custom pfSense Router: Lenovo ThinkCentre M920q Mod Spec Details Built Year 2025 Wi-Fi Support N/A (wired only‚Äîuses separate AP) CPU Intel Core i5‚Äë8500T @ 2.1‚ÄØGHz (6-core) RAM 8‚ÄØGB DDR4 Storage 256‚ÄØGB NVMe SSD Ethernet Ports 1√ó1‚ÄØGbE (onboard) + 2√ó2.5‚ÄØGbE (PCIe mod) Firmware pfSense Notes Everything I wanted that Linksys, TP-Link, and Netgear refused to give me Anticiapted Total Cost $300 Why I‚Äôm Avoiding Cheap ‚ÄúpfSense Boxes‚Äù Many Chinese manufacturers now sell barebones mini-PCs marketed as ‚ÄúpfSense-ready.‚Äù They‚Äôre compact and affordable‚Äîbut there‚Äôs a common theme in user reviews: poor thermal design.\nMost of these boxes rely entirely on passive cooling, with no fans, no airflow planning, and no margin for heat spikes. They often fail within a couple of years. Whether it‚Äôs bad design, cost-cutting, or just laziness, it‚Äôs a dealbreaker for something meant to run 24/7.\nThe ThinkCentre M920q, on the other hand, is small but well-built. Sure, it‚Äôs not perfect‚Äîits compact form limits airflow‚Äîbut at least it has active cooling and a track record of reliability.\nI estimate it will cost me approximatley $10/yr more to run than a regular consumer grade router. But what it gets me in peformance, features, and configurabiltiy makes up for that cost. If it ends up being useful for a adecade, it more than makes up for the extra cost. Indeed, I do not expect 10Gbe ethernet to become affordable for some time ‚Äì manufacturers are have just started introducing 2.5Gbe in their latest offerings of the past 2 years‚Ä¶it will be some time before 10Gbe becomes normalized.\nWrapping Up Consumer routers have come a long way in some areas‚Äîbut they‚Äôve regressed in others. Configurability, transparency, and user empowerment have been traded for lock-in, glossy dashboards, and firmware gimmicks. Aesthetics comes at the price of performance.\nSo I‚Äôm building something better because the market can‚Äôt deliver what I desire.\nStay tuned: I‚Äôll be documenting the full build and config process soon. Who knows, maybe I‚Äôll ask someone to 3d print me a Linksys WRT54G housing or repurpose and old one.\n","wordCount":"2380","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://mdnghtsun.github.io/RootAndReason/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"2025-07-06T18:51:55-07:00","dateModified":"2025-07-06T18:51:55-07:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mdnghtsun.github.io/RootAndReason/posts/building-a-router/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Root \u0026 Reason","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mdnghtsun.github.io/RootAndReason/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://mdnghtsun.github.io/RootAndReason/ accesskey=h title="Root & Reason (Alt + H)"><img src=https://mdnghtsun.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Root & Reason</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

Monitoring features are weak.</p></li><li><p><strong>High-end ($300+)</strong><br>You&rsquo;re mostly paying for marketing: ‚Äúmesh,‚Äù ‚Äúgaming,‚Äù RGB antennas. Hardware‚Äôs better, but it rarely gives you real control.</p></li></ul><hr><h2 id=what-manufacturers-are-pushing-that-i-dont-want>What Manufacturers Are Pushing (That I Don‚Äôt Want)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-manufacturers-are-pushing-that-i-dont-want>#</a></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Mesh systems</strong>: These are often brand-locked and exist to sell you <em>more</em> hardware. It reminds me of early 2000s Wi-Fi gear‚Äîwhere a Linksys adapter worked best with a Linksys router and a NetGear adapter best with a NetGear router. I suspect this is probalby due to differences in firmware and perhaps lack of standards across manufactuers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wi-Fi 6E and 7</strong>: Honestly? I don‚Äôt even know what version I‚Äôm on. Probably Wi-Fi 5. The naming conventions are confusing, and the benefits aren‚Äôt clear to me. It just comes off as marketing nonsense to me. Something to get me hyped up to buy a new router thinking my old one is obsolete.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tri-band & ‚Äúgaming‚Äù routers</strong>: Just marketing bloat, in most cases. Unless you&rsquo;re in a multi-floor household with dozens of high-throughput devices, the extra bands do very little. And the extra antennas look sily. I&rsquo;d rather have more RAM and CPU. Or atleast a router that looks ornamental like a Excalibur (Sword In The Stone), Taj Mahal, Stone Henge. I&rsquo;d even take an Eiffel Tower looking router if its all about big pointy antennas.</p></li></ul><p>Indeed, I found the following:</p><blockquote><p>In the early 2000s, Wi-Fi gear from the same brand often worked better together because:</p><ul><li><strong>Standards were immature</strong> ‚Äì many devices used draft or inconsistent versions of 802.11b/g.</li><li><strong>Vendors added proprietary features</strong> (like Linksys ‚ÄúSpeedBooster‚Äù) that only worked with matching hardware.</li><li><strong>Firmware and driver quality varied</strong>, leading to bugs and compatibility issues.</li><li><strong>Security protocols like WPA</strong> weren‚Äôt consistently supported across brands.</li></ul><p>As a result, pairing a Linksys adapter with a Linksys router often gave more stable and faster connections than mixing brands. This issue largely faded by the 2010s as Wi-Fi standards matured and interoperability improved.</p></blockquote><p>Why manufactuers insist on pushing mesh products in closed ecosystems? Short term profits. You buy their mesh router, you end up buying their mesh nodes. No mix and matching manufactuers makes and models with one another. Closed ecosystem &ndash;> more profits.</p><p>Why manufactuers market Wifi 6 and Wifi 7 instead of giving us more RAM? We&rsquo;d probably upgrade less often otherwise. Create scarcity when ample supply (of RAM) exists. Theres no arugment against power draw here &ndash; its nelgible. no argument against cost either &ndash; RAM gets significantly cheaper every year.</p><p>Why manufacturers insist on designing gaming routers to resemble alien warships is beyond me. It feels like a form of aesthetic gatekeeping‚Äîsignaling that unless your gear looks aggressive and overdesigned, you‚Äôre not a ‚Äúreal‚Äù gamer or as I would say enthusisast.</p><p>Modern consumer routers often feel like they‚Äôre designed for obsolescence from the moment of inception‚Äîoverhyped with flashy aesthetics, underpowered internals, and a locked-down firmware that resists improvement or longevity.</p><p>Real enthusiasts are ahead of the curve, they&rsquo;re early adopters, and they don&rsquo;t like limitations. Honestly, are we getting what we really want? I know I am not.</p><hr><p>It‚Äôs been nearly 25 years since the WRT54G, and while we‚Äôve gotten faster speeds and flashier packaging, core user freedoms and hardware flexibility have regressed. We head aimlessly towards faster speeds be it wifi 7, 8 or 9 and or 2.5Gbe and 10Gbe ethernet connections while neglicting usability (configs) and adequte system resources.</p><p>Don‚Äôt even get me started on the <strong>deceptive hardware revisions</strong>. A model may advertise a certain CPU or RAM size, only for newer batches to quietly downgrade those specs‚Äîwithout any clear distinctions other than the SKUs.</p><h2 id=the-real-problem-locked-down-ui-and-vendor-lock-in>The Real Problem: Locked-Down UI and Vendor Lock-In<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-real-problem-locked-down-ui-and-vendor-lock-in>#</a></h2><p>My biggest frustration with modern consumer routers isn‚Äôt just the hardware‚Äîit‚Äôs the software.</p><p>Most router interfaces are clunky, shallow, and locked down. Want to back up your config? Good luck. Want to reflash it with OpenWRT? Better hope your model wasn‚Äôt quietly locked with a signed bootloader or worse &ndash; gets bricked during the process. Want to restore IP/MAC assignments or VLAN mappings after a reset? You‚Äôll probably have to do it all manually unless the manufacturer kindly included some way to import or export configs. Even then, good luck accomplishing this across different manufacturers let alone different models within the same manufacturer. There is absolutely no standardization in the industry.</p><p>Meanwhile, NAS platforms like <strong>TrueNAS</strong> from iXsystems let you export and restore full system configurations in seconds. That‚Äôs what I expect in 2025. Yet routers like my <strong>TP-Link Archer C8</strong> and even my more recent <strong>Linksys WRT3200ACM</strong> don‚Äôt consistently offer this basic functionality.</p><p>Why is this so rare?</p><hr><h2 id=enter-open-source-pfsense>Enter Open Source: pfSense<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#enter-open-source-pfsense>#</a></h2><p>The open-source community gets it right.

They often fail within a couple of years. Whether it‚Äôs bad design, cost-cutting, or just laziness, it‚Äôs a dealbreaker for something meant to run 24/7.</p><p>The <strong>ThinkCentre M920q</strong>, on the other hand, is small but well-built. Sure, it‚Äôs not perfect‚Äîits compact form limits airflow‚Äîbut at least it has <strong>active cooling</strong> and a track record of reliability.</p><p>I estimate it will cost me approximatley $10/yr more to run than a regular consumer grade router. But what it gets me in peformance, features, and configurabiltiy makes up for that cost. If it ends up being useful for a adecade, it more than makes up for the extra cost. Indeed, I do not expect 10Gbe ethernet to become affordable for some time &ndash; manufacturers are have just started introducing 2.5Gbe in their latest offerings of the past 2 years&mldr;it will be some time before 10Gbe becomes normalized.</p><hr><h2 id=wrapping-up>Wrapping Up<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#wrapping-up>#</a></h2><p>Consumer routers have come a long way in some areas‚Äîbut they‚Äôve regressed in others. Configurability, transparency, and user empowerment have been traded for lock-in, glossy dashboards, and firmware gimmicks. Aesthetics comes at the price of performance.</p><p>So I‚Äôm building something better because the market can&rsquo;t deliver what I desire.</p><p>Stay tuned: I‚Äôll be documenting the full build and config process soon.
