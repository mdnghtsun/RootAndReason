It was just this black box that did the networking. That’s all I needed to know.\nOur first router was one of those all-in-one units bundled with our ISP—SBCGlobal (acquired by AT\u0026T). It was a locked-down piece of junk.\nThe first real router we bought as a family was the one I found recommended in PC Magazine—the legendary Linksys WRT54G. We used that thing for nearly a decade. It was rock solid. It’s funny how companies often forget the products that made them great. The WRT54G was unmatched in its time. Years later, after college, my roommate and I found one in the trash and we rescued it. We modded one to run OpenWRT and It kept going for another three years until 2017, when it finally couldn’t keep up. Its single core processor a didn’t have the processing power to handle modern bandwidth demands—especially with the rise of smart devices and IoT.\nThen came the TP-Link Archer C7/C8/C9. At launch, they were solid contenders. For their price, they outperformed rivals from Netgear, Linksys, and D-Link. Only ASUS came close. But the honeymoon didn’t last. Within five years, they were showing their age. Worse, TP-Link—thanks to what I can only describe as short-sighted engineering—locked the firmware down and made open-source support a nightmare. No OpenWRT, no Tomato, no fun. (DDwrt later became available) And here’s the irony: TP-Link is a Chinese company, yet somehow they’ve created a product that goes against their own communist ideals—no community support, no sharing, and limited redistribution of firmware. You think they’d take their political ideollogy to heart and disrupt the market but I guess it’s only communal when it’s convenient. So now, that once-promising router just sits in storage—exiled like a fallen comrade.\nIn the mid-2010s, Linksys tried to recapture the magic with the WRT3200ACM—a spiritual successor to the WRT54G. I picked one up during the pandemic, and it felt like the legend was back. And to be fair, it held its own for years. But now, five years later, it’s starting to show its limits again – occasional issues with the 5ghz network band to start with. Still, not bad for a router that’s approaching its 10-year mark. 📡 Router Spec Breakdown Here’s a side-by-side look at three routers that defined my home networking journey:\n🔹 Linksys WRT54G Legendary early-2000s router\nSpec Details Release Year ~2002 Wi-Fi Standard 802.11b/g (2.4GHz only) Wi-Fi Speed Up to 54 Mbps CPU Broadcom BCM5352 @ 200 MHz RAM 16 MB (early versions), 8 MB (later versions) Flash Storage 4 MB (2 MB on cost-reduced versions) Ethernet Ports 1 WAN + 4 LAN (10/100 Mbps) Antenna 2x external 2 dBi antennas Open-Source Firmware Excellent (OpenWRT, DD-WRT, Tomato) Notes Revered for hackability, especially v1–v4 🔹 TP-Link Archer C8 Affordable AC-era router that aged poorly\nSpec Details Release Year ~2014 Wi-Fi Standard 802.11ac (dual-band: 2.4GHz + 5GHz) Wi-Fi Speed AC1750 (450 Mbps + 1300 Mbps) CPU Broadcom BCM4708A0 @ 800 MHz (dual-core) RAM 128 MB Flash Storage 16 MB Ethernet Ports 1 WAN + 4 LAN (Gigabit) USB Ports 1x USB 3.0, 1x USB 2.0 Antenna 3x external antennas Open-Source Firmware Poor (locked bootloader on most models) Notes Great price-to-performance at launch, but locked-down firmware limits lifespan 🔹 Linksys WRT3200ACM The spiritual successor to the WRT54G\nSpec Details Release Year 2016 Wi-Fi Standard 802.11ac (dual-band, MU-MIMO support) Wi-Fi Speed AC3200 (600 Mbps + 2600 Mbps theoretical) CPU Marvell Armada 88F6820 @ 1.8 GHz (dual-core) RAM 512 MB DDR3 Flash Storage 256 MB NAND Ethernet Ports 1 WAN + 4 LAN (Gigabit) USB Ports 1x USB 3.0, 1x combo eSATA/USB 2.0 Antenna 4x external high-performance antennas Open-Source Firmware Very good (OpenWRT supported with caveats) Notes Marketed for open-source, but Marvell Wi-Fi driver issues caused long-term headaches 🔹 ASUS RT‑AX5400 Modern dual-band Wi‑Fi 6 router with solid internals\nSpec Details Release Year 2023 Wi‑Fi Standard Wi‑Fi 6 (802.11ax), dual-band Max Speed AX5400 (574 Mbps + 4804 Mbps) CPU Triple-core @ 1.5 GHz RAM 512 MB Flash 256 MB Ethernet 1×2.5 GbE WAN + 4×1 GbE LAN USB Ports 1x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Firmware AsusWRT (with AiProtection, AiMesh) Notes Strong value in the mid-tier; good performance, but closed firmware ecosystem So, Where Are We in 2025? Let’s look at the current state of consumer routers:\n🔹 Asus RT‑BE58U Spec Details Release Year 2024 Wi‑Fi Standard Wi‑Fi 7 (802.11be), dual-band 2.4/5 GHz Max Speed ~3.6 Gbps (688 + 2882 Mbps) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} CPU Quad‑core @ 2.0 GHz :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} RAM 1 GB :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} Flash Storage 256 MB :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} 🔹 Netgear Nighthawk RS300 Spec Details Release Year 2025 Wi‑Fi Standard Wi‑Fi 7, tri-band (2.4/5/6 GHz) Max Speed ~9.3 Gbps :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5} CPU Quad‑core @ 2.0 GHz :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6} RAM 2 GB :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7} Flash Storage 512 MB NAND :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8} 🔹 Netgear Nighthawk Pro Gaming XR1000 (Wi‑Fi 6) Spec Details Release Year 2021 Wi‑Fi Standard Wi‑Fi 6 (802.11ax), AX5400 Max Speed ~5.4 Gbps (600 + 4800 Mbps) :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9} CPU Triple‑core @ 1.5 GHz :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10} RAM / Flash Not specified in official sources 🔹 TP-Link BE3600 (Archer BE3600) Spec Details Release Year 2024 Wi‑Fi Standard Wi‑Fi 7 (802.11be), dual-band Max Speed ~3.6 Gbps (688 + 2882 Mbps) :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11} CPU Quad‑core @ ~2.0 GHz :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12} RAM 2 GB DDR4 :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13} Flash Storage 256 MB :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14} 🔹 TP-Link Archer AX55 Spec Details Release Year 2022 Wi‑Fi Standard Wi‑Fi 6 (AX3000), dual-band Max Speed ~2.976 Gbps (574 + 2402 Mbps) :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15} CPU Dual‑core @ 1.0 GHz (Qualcomm IPQ0518) :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16} RAM 512 MB :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17} Flash Storage 128 MB :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18} 🔹 Asus RT‑BE96U Spec Details Release Year 2024 Wi‑Fi Standard Wi‑Fi 7 (802.11be), tri-band 2.4/5/6 GHz Max Speed ~18.7 Gbps (1.4 + 5.8 + 11.5 Gbps) :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19} CPU Quad‑core @ 2.6 GHz :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20} RAM 2 GB DDR4 :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21} Flash Storage 256 MB :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22} Entry-level (\u003c $100) Still mostly plastic boxes with questionable firmware support, aging chipsets, and zero forward-thinking.\nMid-tier ($100–$300) More capable, but UI/UX remains abysmal. Most still lack configuration backup or meaningful monitoring tools.\nHigh-end ($300+) You’re mostly paying for mesh branding, flashy antennas, and bloated features you’ll never use.\nHonestly? I’m not impressed.\nIt’s been nearly a quarter-century since the WRT54G debuted, and progress feels sluggish. At this rate, we won’t see routers with 16GB RAM and octa-core CPUs in consumer routers until 2050.\nWhats worse is the deceptive marketing. Some models may be noted as having a certain amoutn fo ram or certain type of processor but subdsequent revisions or alt version of it have differenet specs (usually less). You don’t know what you’re buying unless you look at the serial/sku which is honeslty impossible to determine wihtout opening the packaging and exmaining the unit.\nThe Real Problem: UI/UX and Lock-In My biggest frustration? The locked-down UI/UX of most consumer routers.\nI have specific network mappings, and the ability to export and save those configurations is essential. No one wants to manually rebuild IP/MAC address assignments every time something breaks or gets upgraded.\nAnd yet, most manufacturers completely ignore this.\nFor example, iXsystems (the folks behind TrueNAS) lets you export and import full configurations—making migrations painless. My TP-Link Archer C9 didn’t have this. Neither does my current Linksys WRT3200ACM.\nEnter Open Source: pfSense You know who does get it? The open-source community. pfSense.\nWith pfSense, you get:\nFull config export/import Advanced firewall and VLAN controls Monitoring tools that actually work A community that documents everything What’s Next for Me? Thus, for my next project, I’m building a pfSense router—either from:\nA community-recommended office PC (like a Lenovo ThinkCentre), or A small-form-factor ITX build using spare parts. The era of locked-down consumer routers is over. It’s time to build something that actually works for me.\nStay tuned—I’ll be documenting the build process and config setup soon.\nState of The Routers What I Really Desire 2.5G ports (not this 1 2.5Gbe port 4 1gbe port bullshit) quad core 2ghz 1 GB RAM or more opensource capability ability to export and import configs What Companies Are Shoving Down My Throad Mesh routers/networking (i suspect this is because they can sell more products this…a lotof the mesh equipment only works with eqiupment of the same brand. it kind of reminds me of the situation that existed in the early 2000 when wireless networking was first introduced, a lot networking products worked much better with their own product lines – i.e linkssy router with linksys wifi adapter) Wifi6e and Wifi7 (what does the 6e even mean). I am not even on wifi 6. I am not even sure i am on wiif 5 o 4. Why do they call it that? Tri-band and gaming marketing What I Will Build Instead 2x 2.5be ports Quad-core 7th or 8th gen Intel i5T or i7T 8 GB RAM pfsense (and the ability to export and import configs) I’ll use my existing Asus RT-AX5400 router as a access point since Pfsense does not do wifi too well on its own. Instead of building it entirely from scratch (which can increases costs to the $100…), I’ll aim to find a respectable Lenovo Thinkcentre m920q – highly recomended by the enthusasist community for what its capable of acheving under Pfesense.\n🔹 Custom pfSense Router (Lenovo ThinkCentre M920q Mod) Spec Details Built Year 2025 Wi-Fi Standard N/A (wired-only) Wi-Fi Speed N/A CPU Intel Core i5‑8500T @ 2.1 GHz (6-core) RAM 8 GB DDR4 Flash Storage 256 GB NVMe SSD Ethernet Ports 1×1 GbE WAN + 2×2.5 GbE LAN (modded) USB Ports Multiple (USB 3.0 and 2.0) Antenna N/A Firmware pfSense Notes Everything I wanted that Linksys refused to give me. The ironic part is that many of these Chinese manufacturers are now selling low-end, barebones mini-PCs marketed as “pfSense-ready” appliances. But reviewers often report that these devices don’t last more than a couple of years. I strongly suspect they all suffer from the same underlying flaw: inadequate passive cooling.\nNot a single one of these boxes seems to include even a basic cooling fan. Whether this omission is a cost-cutting measure or simply poor design (or both), it’s baffling—especially for devices expected to run 24/7 in a network infrastructure role.\nSo instead of relying on these prebuilt units, I’ve decided to go my own way and build a system that actually meets my standards—starting with proper airflow and thermal management. Understandbly, the small form factor of the Lenovo ThinkCentre M920q is limiiting itself in terms of airflow. But I think its better than passive cooling.\n","wordCount":"1745","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/RootAndReason/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"2025-07-09T18:51:55-07:00","dateModified":"2025-07-09T18:51:55-07:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/RootAndReason/drafts/building-a-router/draft/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Root \u0026 Reason","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/RootAndReason/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/RootAndReason/ accesskey=h title="Root & Reason (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Root & Reason</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

At this rate, we won’t see routers with 16GB RAM and octa-core CPUs in consumer routers until <strong>2050</strong>.</p><p>Whats worse is the deceptive marketing. Some models may be noted as having a certain amoutn fo ram or certain type of processor but subdsequent revisions or alt version of it have differenet specs (usually less).

The locked-down UI/UX of most consumer routers.</p><p>I have specific network mappings, and the ability to export and save those configurations is essential. No one wants to manually rebuild IP/MAC address assignments every time something breaks or gets upgraded.</p><p>And yet, most manufacturers completely ignore this.</p><p>For example, <strong>iXsystems</strong> (the folks behind <a href=https://www.truenas.com>TrueNAS</a>) lets you export and import full configurations—making migrations painless. My <strong>TP-Link Archer C9</strong> didn’t have this.

But reviewers often report that these devices don’t last more than a couple of years. I strongly suspect they all suffer from the same underlying flaw: inadequate passive cooling.</p><p>Not a single one of these boxes seems to include even a basic cooling fan. Whether this omission is a cost-cutting measure or simply poor design (or both), it’s baffling—especially for devices expected to run 24/7 in a network infrastructure role.</p><p>So instead of relying on these prebuilt units, I’ve decided to go my own way and build a system that actually meets my standards—starting with proper airflow and thermal management. Understandbly, the small form factor of the Lenovo ThinkCentre M920q is limiiting itself in terms of airflow. But I think its better than passive cooling.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/RootAndReason/tags/networking/>Networking</a></li><li><a
