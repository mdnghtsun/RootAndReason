description: "From the legendary WRT54G to locked-down firmware nightmares, here's why I'm ditching consumer routers and building my own pfSense box."
---

My first router came bundled with our ISP‚Äî**SBCGlobal**, later acquired by AT&T. It was a locked-down, underwhelming piece of junk. My first *real* router, though, was a legend: the **Linksys WRT54G**, recommended by *PC Magazine*. My family used that thing for nearly a decade. It was rock solid.

Funny how companies forget what made them great. The WRT54G was ahead of its time. Years later, after college, my roommate and I pulled one out of the trash and resurrected it. We modded it with **OpenWRT**, and it ran for another three years until 2017‚Äîwhen it could no longer keep up. Its single-core processor simply couldn‚Äôt handle modern bandwidth demands, let alone the explosion of smart devices and IoT.

Linksys discontinuation of this line is akin to Ford abandoning the Taurus...only bringing it back later. 

---

## When Promise Meets Disappointment

Next came the **TP-Link Archer C7/C8/C9** era. At launch, these were strong contenders‚Äîespecially at their price point. They regularly outperformed routers from Netgear, D-Link, and even Linksys. ASUS came close, but TP-Link had the edge in price-to-performance.

Unfortunately, that promise faded fast. Within five years, they were showing their age. Worse, TP-Link‚Äôs decision to lock down the firmware made open-source support a nightmare. No OpenWRT, no Tomato‚Äîjust headaches. (Eventually, DD-WRT became available, but it felt like an afterthought.)

<img src="tplink-archer-c8.jpg" alt="a new challenger emerges" style="max-width: 300px; display: block; margin: 0; border-radius: 8px;">

Ironically, TP-Link is a Chinese company‚Äîand yet, their product went *against* any spirit of collectivism or community. No sharing, no support, and minimal configurability. You‚Äôd expect a little more openness, but I guess it‚Äôs only communal when it‚Äôs convenient. That once-promising router now sits in storage‚Äîexiled like a fallen comrade.

---

## The Return of a Classic

In the mid-2010s, Linksys tried to recapture the magic with the **WRT3200ACM**‚Äîa spiritual successor to the WRT54G. I picked one up during the pandemic, and for a while, it felt like the legend was back. And to be fair, it held its own for years.

But five years later, it‚Äôs starting to show its limits again‚Äîoccasional issues with the 5GHz band, for example. Still, not bad for a router approaching its ten-year mark. Alas, there is no real sucesssor to the WRT3200ACM offered by Linkssys that I am aware of.

Again, Linksys discontinuation of this line is akin to Ford abandoning the Taurus...for the 2nd time (they really did this)!

## What I Really Want in a Router

Here‚Äôs what I actually care about in a modern router:

- ‚úÖ Dual 2.5GbE ports (not one token 2.5GbE + 4x 1GbE gimmick)
- ‚úÖ Quad-core CPU @ 2.0 GHz or better
- ‚úÖ At least 1 GB of RAM
- ‚úÖ Open-source firmware support
- ‚úÖ The ability to **export and import configurations and mappings**

These aren‚Äôt outlandish demands‚Äîthey‚Äôre just **basic features for power users**. But almost no consumer router on the market delivers this combination out of the box consistently other than NetGate and maybe Ubiquiti though both are considered prosumer if not enterprise and thus quite pricy some even costing as much as $600 or $900.

### üß© Market Summary

- **Entry-level (< $100)**  
  Still mostly plastic boxes with questionable firmware support, aging chipsets, and no forward-thinking features.

- **Mid-tier ($100‚Äì$300)**  
  More capable hardware, but UI/UX remains clunky. Still no standard config backup/export tools (like what if I wanted to export configs between makes and models). Monitoring features are weak.

- **High-end ($300+)**  
  You're mostly paying for marketing: ‚Äúmesh,‚Äù ‚Äúgaming,‚Äù RGB antennas. Hardware‚Äôs better, but it rarely gives you real control.

---

## What Manufacturers Are Pushing (That I Don‚Äôt Want)

- **Mesh systems**: These are often brand-locked and exist to sell you *more* hardware. It reminds me of early 2000s Wi-Fi gear‚Äîwhere a Linksys adapter worked best with a Linksys router and a NetGear adapter best with a NetGear router. I suspect this is probalby due to differences in firmware and perhaps lack of standards across manufactuers. 


- **Wi-Fi 6E and 7**: Honestly? I don‚Äôt even know what version I‚Äôm on. Probably Wi-Fi 5. The naming conventions are confusing, and the benefits aren‚Äôt clear to me. It just comes off as marketing nonsense to me. Something to get me hyped up to buy a new router thinking my old one is obsolete. 

- **Tri-band & ‚Äúgaming‚Äù routers**: Just marketing bloat, in most cases. Unless you're in a multi-floor household with dozens of high-throughput devices, the extra bands do very little. And the extra antennas look sily. I'd rather have more RAM and CPU. Or atleast a router that looks ornamental like a Excalibur (Sword In The Stone), Taj Mahal, Stone Henge. I'd even take an Eiffel Tower looking router if its all about big pointy antennas. 


Indeed, ChatGPT concurs:
> In the early 2000s, Wi-Fi gear from the same brand often worked better together because:  
>  
> - **Standards were immature** ‚Äì many devices used draft or inconsistent versions of 802.11b/g.  
> - **Vendors added proprietary features** (like Linksys ‚ÄúSpeedBooster‚Äù) that only worked with matching hardware.  
> - **Firmware and driver quality varied**, leading to bugs and compatibility issues.  
> - **Security protocols like WPA** weren‚Äôt consistently supported across brands.  
>  
> As a result, pairing a Linksys adapter with a Linksys router often gave more stable and faster connections than mixing brands. This issue largely faded by the 2010s as Wi-Fi standards matured and interoperability improved.

Why manufactuers insist on pushing mesh products in closed ecosystems? Short term profits. You buy their mesh router, you end up buying their mesh nodes. No mix and matching manufactuers makes and models with one another. Closed ecosystem --> more profits.

Why manufactuers market Wifi 6 and Wifi 7 instead of giving us more RAM? We'd probably upgrade less often otherwise. Create scarcity when ample supply (of RAM) exists. Theres no arugment against power draw here -- its nelgible. no argument against cost either -- RAM gets significantly cheaper every year. 

Why manufacturers insist on designing gaming routers to resemble alien warships is beyond me. It feels like a form of aesthetic gatekeeping‚Äîsignaling that unless your gear looks aggressive and overdesigned, you‚Äôre not a ‚Äúreal‚Äù gamer or as I would say enthusisast. 

Modern consumer routers often feel like they‚Äôre designed for obsolescence from the moment of inception‚Äîoverhyped with flashy aesthetics, underpowered internals, and a locked-down firmware that resists improvement or longevity.

Real enthusiasts are ahead of the curve, they're early adopters, and they don't like limitations. Honestly, are we getting what we really want? I know I am not. 

---

It‚Äôs been nearly 25 years since the WRT54G, and while we‚Äôve gotten faster speeds and flashier packaging, core user freedoms and hardware flexibility have regressed. We head aimlessly towards faster speeds be it wifi 7, 8 or 9 and or 2.5Gbe and 10Gbe ethernet connections while neglicting usability (configs) and adequte system resources. 

Don‚Äôt even get me started on the **deceptive hardware revisions**. A model may advertise a certain CPU or RAM size, only for newer batches to quietly downgrade those specs‚Äîwithout any clear distinctions other than the SKUs. 

## The Real Problem: Locked-Down UI and Vendor Lock-In

My biggest frustration with modern consumer routers isn‚Äôt just the hardware‚Äîit‚Äôs the software.

Most router interfaces are clunky, shallow, and locked down. Want to back up your config? Good luck. Want to reflash it with OpenWRT? Better hope your model wasn‚Äôt quietly locked with a signed bootloader or worse -- gets bricked during the process. Want to restore IP/MAC assignments or VLAN mappings after a reset? You‚Äôll probably have to do it all manually unless the manufacturer kindly included some way to import or export configs. Even then, good luck accomplishing this across different manufacturers let alone different models within the same manufacturer. There is absolutely no standardization in the industry. 

Meanwhile, NAS platforms like **TrueNAS** from iXsystems let you export and restore full system configurations in seconds. That‚Äôs what I expect in 2025. Yet routers like my **TP-Link Archer C8** and even my more recent **Linksys WRT3200ACM** don‚Äôt consistently offer this basic functionality.

Why is this so rare?

## Enter Open Source: pfSense

The open-source community gets it right. Specifically, **pfSense**.

With pfSense, you get:

- ‚úÖ Full configuration export/import
- ‚úÖ VLANs, traffic shaping, firewall rules‚Äîwithout artificial limits
- ‚úÖ Logs and monitoring tools that are actually useful
- ‚úÖ Documentation and community support that doesn‚Äôt leave you guessing

Instead of marketing gimmicks and firmware restrictions, pfSense gives you **control**‚Äîwhich is all I‚Äôve ever really wanted from a router.

---

## What‚Äôs Next for Me

So, I‚Äôm building my own router.

I‚Äôll either:

- Repurpose a community-favorite office PC like the **Lenovo ThinkCentre**, or  
- Build a small-form-factor ITX box using spare parts.

Either way, I‚Äôm done with closed ecosystems that treat configurability like an afterthought.

- ‚úÖ pfSense with full config export/import  
- ‚úÖ My existing ASUS RT-AX5400 will serve as a Wi-Fi access point

Rather than build everything from scratch (which can easily drive costs over $100), I‚Äôm aiming for a used **Lenovo ThinkCentre M920q**‚Äîhighly recommended by the pfSense community for its reliability, efficiency, and mod potential.

## Why I‚Äôm Avoiding Cheap ‚ÄúpfSense Boxes‚Äù

Many Chinese manufacturers now sell barebones mini-PCs marketed as "pfSense-ready." They‚Äôre compact and affordable‚Äîbut there‚Äôs a common theme in user reviews: **poor thermal design**.

Most of these boxes rely entirely on passive cooling, with no fans, no airflow planning, and no margin for heat spikes. They often fail within a couple of years. Whether it‚Äôs bad design, cost-cutting, or just laziness, it‚Äôs a dealbreaker for something meant to run 24/7.

The **ThinkCentre M920q**, on the other hand, is small but well-built. Sure, it‚Äôs not perfect‚Äîits compact form limits airflow‚Äîbut at least it has **active cooling** and a track record of reliability.

I estimate it will cost me approximatley $10/yr more to run than a regular consumer grade router. But what it gets me in peformance, features, and configurabiltiy makes up for that cost. If it ends up being useful for a adecade, it more than makes up for the extra cost. Indeed, I do not expect 10Gbe ethernet to become affordable for some time -- manufacturers are have just started introducing 2.5Gbe in their latest offerings of the past 2 years...it will be some time before 10Gbe becomes normalized.

## Wrapping Up

Consumer routers have come a long way in some areas‚Äîbut they‚Äôve regressed in others. Configurability, transparency, and user empowerment have been traded for lock-in, glossy dashboards, and firmware gimmicks. Aesthetics comes at the price of performance. 

So I‚Äôm building something better because the market can't deliver what I desire. 

Stay tuned: I‚Äôll be documenting the full build and config process soon. Who knows, maybe I'll ask someone to 3d print me a Linksys WRT54G housing or repurpose and old one.
