I’ve been reading *Ali: Elixir of Love*, and this line struck me with its timeless moral clarity. It captures a universality that bridges faith and human dignity — something I think the modern world desperately needs to rediscover (more reflections coming soon.)

Overall, I am througly enjoying the book and highly recomend it to anyone interested in history, the middle east, or a desire to understand the Islamic world better.
